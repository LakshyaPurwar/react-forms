# react-forms
Repository for the perfect react  form prototype.
Went through everything required to handled when dealing with forms.

Utilized all three feedback: 

1.Field valid  / invalid , first when focus lost ,listend  every keystroke for correction.

2.Overall Form valid , invalid and disabling the submit button accordingly.

3.All the aspects associated with an input field encapsulated within a single useInput hook that can be used conveniently.

4.Finally , made use of useReducer instead of the two useState variables to practice the concept.

//Perfect.
